# CSFValentineProgram
A program for the CSF club at school to use for creating a match system for their Valentine's Day Fundraiser.

Hello whoever is reading this right now,

My name is Corban Anderson, and I am the creator (or at least original creator) of Wilcox's CSFValentine Assigning/Sorting Valentine's Day program. In this file I will detail a brief overview of the project, how to use the program, and some of the more challenging/annoying topics.

<h3>Overview of the project</h3>

This is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of a terminal version that I created a couple months ago. This program was originally written as a student sorter and assigner for the Wilcox High School CSF Club fundraiser. Essentially all it does is it takes in data from an external spreadsheet (supported file types are .xlsx, .csv, and .tsv) and spits out a list for each student of their top 15 or so students that would be best for them as friends or further.

While writing this program I took great care to make it as customizable as possible so that for the most part the CSF club can do whatever they want many years after I am gone. For example, in addition to a number of different score types and supported questions, users (I will refer to "users" as the operators running the program, and "students" as the general population that simply fills out a survey) can also customize how many students are displayed on a sheet, the font sizes of all the text, how to display student names, and other categories on the results form, and can even customize the final image to their liking.

I hope that others who come along later will also respect this need for end-user customization.

Though I originally had a terminal version of the program, I through nearly everything out of the terminal version when making the GUI version. There were only ~2 methods that were in the terminal version that I ported over to the GUI version, which now live in the Backend.java file.

This program was thrown together in about a week and a half, so I do expect there to be errors (in fact I am positive there are errors). I thank anyone who else who comes along and spends their time to help the project! Also anyone else who wants to use the project for their own purposes, please go right ahead! Don't bother me, just go download it!

<h3>How to use the program</h3>

<h4>Question import and set up</h4>

The program should start up in the "Welcome!" screen, it should be pretty self explanitory. Just one note, very early .csfv versions that were generated by my terminal version are not supported by the GUI version. Because no one has the original files, this doesn't matter too much. Another thing to note is that the current .csfv files are saved in plain text, though this is purposeful, some users might be fearful of security concerns.

The beast is the question import stage of the process. For each question, you will see a set of options that you can customize. The first two checkboxes, whether to import and whether it is used in sorting, should generally be never touched. It is best practice to import all of the questions, always, this makes it easier if you plan on importing more students later. When you select the question type, depending on the question type the question will/will not be used for sorting automatically. For example, short answer questions are not used in sorting, and thus messing with the "Used in Sorting" checkbox is meaningless.

The score type drop down determines how to interpret the percentage from the check of two students' answers. Percentage leaves it how it is, inverted percentage inverts it, and so on. For a detailed look at all of the gates, have a peek at the ScoreType.java file.

The short value textbox is if you would like to have this question show up in the simularities area on the student results sheet. Ideally this should be a short value which describes the question throughly/or the attribute the question was testing. Two questions can have the same short value, but that short value will only show up once on the results sheet even if the student did well in both questions.

Just a quick tip for the multiple choice, if you have a lot of options that you need to add, go on the Google Form how the students would see it, then just easily select the options displayed.

The third checkbox is whether or not this question is determinitive. Aka, after applying the score type on the percentage, if the percentage is not 100%, the student being compared will not show up on the student's list of students. For example. John is a boy and would prefer to have girls show up on his results sheet. The questions "What is your sex?" and "What sex would you like to be matched with?" would both be marked as determinitive because in the assigning process, when John is being compared to Carl, Carl should not show up on John's list at all, even if Carl scored high for John in all of the other questions.

A word on how multiple choice (and checkbox and dropdown) questions are compared (before applying the score type). Say on a question John selected options 1 and 2, Carl selected options 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For John, Carl would have a score of 100% because Carl had all of the options that John had. For Carl on the other hand, John would return a score of 40% because John only had 2/5 of Carl's choices. We would apply a Boolean OR score type if the question was determinitive and we thought that these results were acceptable.

<h4>Couple Questions</h4>

Once you are done with this screen and click next, you will be asked if you would like to add any couple questions. The idea behind coupled questions is that in the assigning stage the answer of John on question 2 (if it is coupled to question 3) would be compared to Carl's answer on question 3, and vis versa, John's answer to question 3, would be compared to Carl's answer on question 2. This functionality is useful for pairs of questions like "What is your grade?" and "What grades do you want to be matched with?" Where John's "Senior" should be instead compared to Carl's "Junior, Senior."

<h4>Navigating the Primary Screen</h4>

Once all of this is done. You will find yourself on the Main Screen. Right in front of you will be a table of all of the info that was imported. This table can be editted, but with caution because it is easy to mess up, and there is currently no undo function built in.

At the top are three tabs, the Student Data tab which you are in, a Questions tab where you can edit the questions and can go edit the coupled questions, and a Print Shop tab.

There are also menu options along the top which is where you can do basic tasks like saving (though the project almost always autosaves after most actions), saving as, opening, etc. but also here you can import print settings and more students.

<h4>The Print Shop</h4>

The print shop page is where you can fully customize your results look. Here you can set the main/minor font sizes, the number of students per sheet, the minimum image height, a custom message for students when they get their results sheet, the number of similarity rows to show, the amount of space to have between the prints, a custom image, the ink darkness of the image, the name format, and the result item formats and locations.

Most of these are self explanitory, if you aren't sure what numbers you can put in, hover over the textbox for the tooltip which gives the bounds of acceptable values. For the name format and result formats, any text will be displayed as text, numbers will be displayed as the student's answers to that question number, and a % will be replaced by the percent final score of that student.

From there you can choose which students you want to print out, and then hit the print button. This will go through the process of assigning the students, then a print dialog will pop up (sometimes it takes a moment), and if there were any errors during the assignment, an error dialog will come up telling which students had trouble during the assignment. Usually errors will occur for one of two reasons. Either an option wasn't typed correctly/missing on the question set up screen, or a student had bad input on their end. Fix these errors then press print again for better results.

I highly recommend downloading a print to pdf program from online, if your machine doesn't already do it by default.

<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know that it is quite long, but I hope it was worth it. Please feel free to download the files and run the program yourself!
