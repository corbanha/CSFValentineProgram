# CSFValentineProgram
A program for the CSF club at school to use for creating a match system for their Valentine's Day Fundraiser.

Hello whoever is reading this right now,

My name is Corban Anderson, and I am the creator (or at least original creator) of Wilcox's CSFValentine Assigning/Sorting Valentine's Day program. In this file I will detail a brief overview of the project, how to use the program, and some of the more challenging/annoying topics.

<h3>Overview of the project</h3>

This is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of a terminal version that I created a couple months ago. This program was originally written as a student sorter and assigner for the Wilcox High School CSF Club fundraiser. Essentially all it does is it takes in data from an external spreadsheet (supported file types are .xlsx, .csv, and .tsv) and spits out a list for each student of their top 15 or so students that would be best for them as friends or further.

While writing this program I took great care to make it as customizable as possible so that for the most part the CSF club can do whatever they want many years after I am gone. For example, in addition to a number of different score types and supported questions, users (I will refer to "users" as the operators running the program, and "students" as the general population that simply fills out a survey) can also customize how many students are displayed on a sheet, the font sizes of all the text, how to display student names, and other categories on the results form, and can even customize the final image to their liking.

I hope that others who come along later will also respect this need for end-user customization.

Though I originally had a terminal version of the program, I through nearly everything out of the terminal version when making the GUI version. There were only ~2 methods that were in the terminal version that I ported over to the GUI version, which now live in the Backend.java file.

This program was thrown together in about a week and a half, so I do expect there to be errors (in fact I am positive there are errors). I thank anyone who else who comes along and spends their time to help the project! Also anyone else who wants to use the project for their own purposes, please go right ahead! Don't bother me, just go download it!

<h3>How to use the program</h3>

The program should start up in the "Welcome!" screen, it should be pretty self explanitory. Just one note, very early .csfv versions that were generated by my terminal version are not supported by the GUI version. Because no one has the original files, this doesn't matter too much. Another thing to note is that the current .csfv files are saved in plain text, though this is purposeful, some users might be fearful of security concerns.

The beast is the question import stage of the process. For each question, you will see a set of options that you can customize. The first two checkboxes, whether to import and whether it is used in sorting, should generally be never touched. It is best practice to import all of the questions, always, this makes it easier if you plan on importing more students later. When you select the question type, depending on the question type the question will/will not be used for sorting automatically. For example, short answer questions are not used in sorting, and thus messing with the "Used in Sorting" checkbox is meaningless.

The score type drop down determines how to interpret the percentage from the check of two students' answers. Percentage leaves it how it is, inverted percentage inverts it, and so on. For a detailed look at all of the gates, have a peek at the ScoreType.java file.

The short value textbox is if you would like to have this question show up in the simularities area on the student results sheet. Ideally this should be a short value which describes the question throughly/or the attribute the question was testing. Two questions can have the same short value, but that short value will only show up once on the results sheet even if the student did well in both questions.

Just a quick tip for the multiple choice, if you have a lot of options that you need to add, go on the Google Form how the students would see it, then just easily select the options displayed.

The third checkbox is whether or not this question is determinitive. Aka, after applying the score type on the percentage, if the percentage is not 100%, the student being compared will not show up on the student's list of students. For example. John is a boy and would prefer to have girls show up on his results sheet. The questions "What is your sex?" and "What sex would you like to be matched with?" would both be marked as determinitive because in the assigning process, when John is being compared to Carl, Carl should not show up on John's list at all, even if Carl scored high for John in all of the other questions.

A word on how 

Once you are done with this screen and click next, you will be asked if you would like to add any couple questions. The idea behind coupled questions is that in the assigning stage the answer of John on question 2 (if it is coupled to question 3) would be compared to Carl's answer on question 3, and vis versa, John's answer to question 3, would be compared to Carl's answer on question 2.
