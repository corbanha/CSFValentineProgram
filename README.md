# CSFValentineProgram
A program for the CSF club at school to use for creating a match system for their Valentine's Day Fundraiser.

Hello whoever is reading this right now,

My name is Corban Anderson, and I am the creator (or at least original creator) of Wilcox's CSFValentine Assigning/Sorting Valentine's Day program. In this file I will detail a brief overview of the project, how to use the program, and some of the more challenging/annoying topics.

-Overview of the project
This is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of a terminal version that I created a couple months ago. This program was originally written as a student sorter and assigner for the Wilcox High School CSF Club fundraiser. Essentially all it does is it takes in data from an external spreadsheet (supported file types are .xlsx, .csv, and .tsv) and spits out a list for each student of their top 15 or so students that would be best for them as friends or further.

While writing this program I took great care to make it as customizable as possible so that for the most part the CSF club can do whatever they want many years after I am gone. For example, in addition to a number of different score types and supported questions, users (I will refer to "users" as the operators running the program, and "students" as the general population that simply fills out a survey) can also customize how many students are displayed on a sheet, the font sizes of all the text, how to display student names, and other categories on the results form, and can even customize the final image to their liking.

I hope that others who come along later will also respect this need for end-user customization.

Though I originally had a terminal version of the program, I through nearly everything out of the terminal version when making the GUI version. There were only ~2 methods that were in the terminal version that I ported over to the GUI version, which now live in the Backend.java file.

This program was thrown together in about a week and a half, so I do expect there to be errors (in fact I am positive there are errors). I thank anyone who else who comes along and spends their time to help the project! Also anyone else who wants to use the project for their own purposes, please go right ahead! Don't bother me, just go download it!

-How to use the program
The program should start up in the "Welcome!" screen, if you end up with the program automatically opening a project, go to File -> New. On the Welcome screen you can simply start by creating a new project by filling in the textboxes, or you can load a previous .csfv project from the "Open Existing" button. Note that very early .csfv versions that were generated by my terminal version are not supported by the GUI version (sad face!).

Next you will come to the question set up screen. Here you will customize each of the questions. I recommend importing all of the questions even if you won't use them for sorting, this way it is easy to import more students later. Have the Google Form which you used open while you are doing this process. First set the question type. The "Used For Sorting" checkbox is only useful if the question is a question that is supported for sorting (like linear scale, multiple choice, checkboxes, and drop down), all other question types can't be used for sorting anyway, so checking the box is meaningless for those questions.
